# Heart Failure Prediction Project

A data science project done as part of the Spring 2025 Data Science course at GIU.  
We analyzed the Heart Failure dataset and built ML models to predict patient outcomes.

Assignment 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning
Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
What we did:

Cleaned up messy datasets
Handled missing values and outliers
Plotted data trends and correlations

Assignment 2: Classification
Algorithms: KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest
What we did:

Trained and tested models
Compared accuracy and confusion matrices
Used train/test splits & cross-validation

Assignment 3: Clustering
Algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative, GMM, BIRCH
What we did:

Clustered data using unsupervised learning
Measured quality with silhouette score
Visualized clusters

Datasets Used
Kaggle
UCI ML Repository

Tech Stack
Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
