# Heart Failure Prediction Project

A data science project done as part of the Spring 2025 Data Science course at GIU.  
We analyzed the Heart Failure dataset and built ML models to predict patient outcomes.

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Trained models: Decision Tree, SVM
- Achieved 85%+ accuracy with Decision Tree

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
