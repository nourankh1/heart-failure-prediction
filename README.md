# Heart Failure Prediction Project

A data science project done as part of the Spring 2025 Data Science course at GIU.  
We analyzed the Heart Failure dataset and built ML models to predict patient outcomes.

  Assignment 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning
  Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
  What we did:
  
  Cleaned up messy datasets
  Handled missing values and outliers
  Plotted data trends and correlations

  Assignment 2: Classification
  Algorithms: KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest
  What we did:
  
  Trained and tested models
  Compared accuracy and confusion matrices
  Used train/test splits & cross-validation

  Assignment 3: Clustering
  Algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative, GMM, BIRCH
  What we did:
  
  Clustered data using unsupervised learning
  Measured quality with silhouette score
  Visualized clusters

  Datasets Used
  Kaggle
  UCI ML Repository

  Tech Stack
  Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
  scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
