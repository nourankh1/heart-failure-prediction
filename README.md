# Heart Failure Prediction Project

A data science project done as part of the Spring 2025 Data Science course at GIU.  
We analyzed the Heart Failure dataset and built ML models to predict patient outcomes.

Assignment 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning
Cleaned and prepared raw datasets

Handled missing values and outliers

Visualized data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

Assignment 2: Classification
Trained KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models

Used train/test split and cross-validation

Compared models using accuracy and confusion matrices

Assignment 3: Clustering
Applied K-Means, Agglomerative, GMM, and BIRCH clustering

Evaluated using silhouette score

Visualized clustering results

Tools Used
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Datasets
Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository
